# ðŸŒŒ Celestial Data Transport System

The **Celestial Data Transport System** is a secure, verifiable, and extensible blockchain-based protocol written in Clarity. It enables the transmission of energy-based payloads between cosmic entities with support for arbitration, failover, cryptographic validation, and zero-knowledge verification.

---

## ðŸš€ Features

- **Staged Energy Transmission**: Transmit resources in defined phases over a stellar cycle.
- **Transmission Arbitration**: Initiate and resolve disputes between origin and target entities.
- **Failover Strategy**: Delegate recovery and control operations in case of anomalies.
- **Cryptographic Validation**: Use signatures to verify transmission authenticity.
- **Zero-Knowledge Proof Support**: Optionally prove data correctness without revealing it.
- **Advanced Security Activation**: Secure high-value transmissions with enhanced controls.
- **Metadata Extension**: Append specs, receipts, validation hashes, or configs to transmissions.
- **Rate Limiting**: Limit retry attempts and impose cooldowns.
